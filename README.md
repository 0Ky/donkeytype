# Donkeytype

very minimalistic **_cli_** typing test

### Todo

-   [ ] count wpm only in words that were typed correctly
-   [ ] save results
-   [ ] handle alt+backspace to delete last word from input
-   [ ] support numbers and symbols
-   [ ] figure out a way to mock tui::widgets::Widget to test if expected text is rendered
-   [ ] add support for more languages
-   [ ] handle unicode characters (e.g. `ł`, `ń`, `ü`, `ß`)
-   [ ] add integration tests
